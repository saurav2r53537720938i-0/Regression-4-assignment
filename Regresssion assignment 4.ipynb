    "The main advantage of using Lasso regression in feature slection is its ablity to automatically perform variable  slection by shrnking the cofficent of less important feature to zero.This results in a sparse model where only the mostt relvent feature are retained making the model simpler and potentially more interpretable addtionaly by reducing the number of feature ,lasso regularization can help mitigate the risk of overfitting and improve the genrlaisation performance of the model"
